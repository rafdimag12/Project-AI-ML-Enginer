The master project is **Read-Only**, meaning you can edit, but it will not be saved when you close the master project. To avoid total loss of your work, remember to make a copy.\n",

        "3. **Creating a Google Drive Folder**: Each of you must create a new folder on your Google Drive. This will be the repository for all your completed project files, aiding you in keeping your work organized and accessible.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Uploading Completed Project**: Upon completion of your project, make sure to upload all necessary files, involving codes, reports, and related documents into the created Google Drive folder. Save this link in the 'Student Identity' section and also provide it as the last parameter in the `submit` function that has been provided.\n",
